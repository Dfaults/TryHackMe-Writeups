Hi, my name is Dfaults I'm a Cyber Security student who aside from wanting to work in this field I also enjoy doing CTF challenges as one of my hobbies as a way to both keep me up to date with certain technologies and vulnerabilities as well as doing some mental exercise.

This was made with the intention of providing evidence of work done towards furthering education in cyber security as well as keeping track of any potencial knowledge bits I might find along the way that may be useful to thos starting out on this journey that might not be covered by those with higher knowledge or experience since it's common to have assumptions of baseline knowledge even if it's not necessarily true in every circumstance.

This projects is structured to have every room done contained in it's own markdown file both for convinience of writing and being read with just about any editor that supports markdown. The assets folder conatians all screenshots presented in the reports regardless of where they are featured in the documents (in case anyone want to only have the screenshots for whatever reason). The more CTF like rooms will be in their separate forlders since there will be contained any noteworthy information regarding that particular challenge just to keep it organized and easy to access for anyone looking for details on a specific room that I have done in the past and how I went about solving it, that said, each of those rooms will have slight differences since no room is exactly the same as the others and both the information I find and the notes I take will differ according to my knowledgebase as it progresses.

Finally i'd like to take a moment of your time to tell you I also run a very small youtube channel under the same handle where I try to post soothing music for when you're working on your challenges as for the better part of my experience searching for tutorials I got the deafening roars of either techno or just very loud music that made the whole explanation almost impossible to understand beyond what i could see, if you're one of those more visual learners like me and want to have this same information presented here feel free to reach out to me over on my channel and I will do my best to cover the room as soon as i'm able to.
